## Sliding Window

### Description

The Sliding Window pattern is useful for solving problems that deal with subarrays or subsequences of a fixed length or other conditions. The idea is to create a 'window' of items (either contiguous or with some condition) and slide it across the data structure, calculating some property (sum, max, min, etc.) as we go.

### Visualization

Imagine a highlighter that scans through a line of text. You can only see the text under the highlighter. Now think of the "highlighted text" as the current subarray you're focusing on.

### Keywords

- Maximum/Minimum subarray
- Contiguous subarray
- Fixed length

## Two Pointers

### Description

The Two Pointers pattern is typically used with sorted arrays or linked lists. You start with two pointers at different positions and move them based on certain conditions.

### Visualization

Imagine you're reading a book with both hands, one hand at the beginning and the other at the end. Both hands move towards each other as you skim through the book to find something.

### Keywords

- Sorted array
- Pair with given sum
- Opposite ends

---

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

### Description

BFS is typically used for tree and graph traversal. It explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next level of depth.

### Visualization

Imagine a tree where you start at the root and then move level by level, left to right, exploring each node.

### Keywords

- Level order traversal
- Shortest path
- Adjacent nodes

---

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

### Description

DFS is used for traversing trees and graphs. It starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Visualization

Imagine a tree where you start at the root and go as deep as possible down one branch before coming back up.

### Keywords

- Tree path
- Sum of paths
- Backtracking
